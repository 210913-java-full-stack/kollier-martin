# DB Tables Needed
# CUSTOMERS (USER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, EMAIL, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME) : A customer can have multiple ACCOUNT_IDs tied to them, but only one CUSTOMER_ID
# ACCOUNTS (ACCOUNT_ID, ACCOUNT_TYPE, BALANCE) : A customer can have multiple accounts, but the ACCOUNT_IDs must be different
# AC_JUNCTION (JUNCTION_ID, ACCOUNT_ID, CUSTOMER_ID) : A junction table that ties CUSTOMERS and ACCOUNTS together
# USERINFO (USER_ID, PASSWORD, USER_ID) : A table containing the user login info based on CUSTOMER_ID
